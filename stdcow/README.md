# STDCOW
A basic standard library created by me to use data-structures and algorithms in C.

### List of Data Structures to implement:
- [ ] Vectors (i.e. Dynamic Arrays)
- [ ] Strings
- [ ] Hashmaps
- [ ] Linked List (most probably Unrolled Doubly Linked List)
- [ ] ADT:: Stack, Queues, Priority Queue, Set, Heap
- [ ] Trees:: Binary, Read-Black Trees
- [ ] Tries

### List of Algorithms to implement:
- [ ] Pseudo-random number generator
- [ ] DFS and BFS
- [ ] Binary search
- [ ] Sequence and Fuzzy matching
- [ ] String search algorithm
- [ ] Huffman-encoding
